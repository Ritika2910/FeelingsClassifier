**Feeling Classifiers on Amazon Reviews**
#Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using NLTK for traditional NLP techniques and Transformers for deep learning-based sentiment classification. The goal is to classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral based on textual content.

#Technologies Used

Python – Primary programming language

NLTK – Used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

Transformers (Hugging Face) – Used for sentiment classification using pre-trained models like BERT

Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization
**Dataset**

The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, including review text and corresponding ratings. The reviews are preprocessed and used to train/evaluate sentiment classification models.

#Project Workflow

#Data Preprocessing

Tokenization and text cleaning using NLTK
