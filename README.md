**Sentiment Analysis  on Amazon Reviews**
**Overview**

This project performs sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews using NLTK for traditional NLP techniques and Transformers for deep learning-based sentiment classification. The goal is to classify customer reviews as positive 😊, negative 😠, or neutral 😐 based on textual content.

**🔍Technologies Used**

🐍 Python – Primary programming language

📖 NLTK – Used for text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)

🤗 Transformers (Hugging Face) – Used for sentiment classification using pre-trained models like BERT

📊 Pandas & NumPy – For data manipulation and analysis

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn – For data visualization
**📂Dataset**

The dataset consists of Amazon product reviews, including review text and corresponding ratings. The reviews are preprocessed and used to train/evaluate sentiment classification models.

*Project Workflow*

**Data Preprocessing**

1.Tokenization and text cleaning using NLTK

2.Stopword removal and stemming

3.Converting text to numerical representations

**Sentiment Classification**

1.Traditional approach using NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

2.Deep learning-based approach using pre-trained Transformer models

3.Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix

**Results & Insights**

1.Comparison of traditional and deep learning methods

2.Performance evaluation and key takeaways
